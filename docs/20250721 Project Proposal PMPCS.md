### Project Proposal: Development of a Lightweight P2P Message-Based Payment Confirmation Backend (v2)  


Below is the full updated Project Proposal incorporating these changes for Phase 1, building on the decentralized update from July 22, 2025.

#### 1. Project Overview
This proposal, revised as of July 22, 2025, outlines the development of a simple, peer-to-peer (P2P) backend system designed to facilitate message-based payment confirmations. The system will operate on Linux environments for development (laptop) and testing/production (cloud instances). It will expose a RESTful API with endpoints for generating, processing, and validating payment-related messages, which users can copy and paste into any messaging platform, including offline-compatible ones such as BitChat. To enhance usability, the backend will also support the generation and processing of QR code images for platforms allowing image attachments, providing an alternative to text-based messages. The backend will emphasize minimalism, security through verifiable credentials, and extensibility to support future integrations.

To address centralization concerns and enable true P2P operation, this update introduces a decentralized architecture using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) as per W3C standards. This eliminates reliance on a central server for session management and validation, allowing direct peer verification via cryptographic proofs. Phase 1 now includes user validation endpoints for decoding messages to JSON and confirming validity, enhancing transparency without requiring full decentralization yet.

The project addresses an identified need for a platform-agnostic service that enhances security, efficiency, and interoperability in P2P transactions. By enabling verifiable confirmations without direct payment processing, it supports diverse use cases while remaining lightweight and user-controlled.

#### 2. Objectives
- To create a backend API that generates, validates, and confirms payment messages in a secure, tamper-evident manner, including support for QR code images as an alternative sharing format.
- To incorporate features for payee preferences, session management, verifiable certificates, and user validation (decoding to JSON and validity confirmation) to enable integration with external systems for releasing goods or services.
- To ensure compatibility with arbitrary messaging platforms through compact, copy-paste-friendly messages or QR code images.
- To provide foundational functionality that supports scalability and future expansions without introducing unnecessary complexity.

#### 3. Scope and Key Features
The initial implementation will focus on core API endpoints and functional enhancements, as detailed below. The system will not handle actual payment execution, regulatory compliance, or advanced fraud detection, as these are delegated to higher-level systems.

##### 3.1 API Endpoints
- **POST /paymentRequest**: Accepts details such as amount, currency, recipient ID, description, and payee preferences. Generates a Base64-encoded message (with optional compression) including a unique session ID, message ID (for duplicate prevention), expiry timestamp, and verifiable credential schema. Optionally returns a QR code image embedding the same payload for platforms supporting image attachments. Payee preferences will be structured as an array of objects (e.g., method codes like "BTC" or "BANK_TRANSFER" with extendable parameters such as wallet addresses or account numbers), supplemented by a textual fallback for custom descriptions.
- **POST /paymentSent**: Processes sender confirmation with session ID, paid amount (supporting partial payments), transaction proof, and optional custom method if preferences are unfulfilled. Generates a confirmation message and issues a verifiable certificate, with an optional QR code image for sharing.
- **POST /paymentReceived**: Validates pasted messages or uploaded QR code images (decoded server-side), checks for duplicates via message ID, enforces expiry, and updates session status. Returns validation results and, if applicable, a verifiable certificate.
- **POST /decodeMessage**: Accepts an encoded message or QR code image. Decodes it to JSON format, performs basic validation (e.g., expiry, format integrity), and returns the decoded JSON with a validity flag. (New in Phase 1 for user validation.)
- **GET /session/{session_id}**: Queries the current status of a session (e.g., pending, sent, received), including details like requested amount, paid amount, preferences, and certificate.

##### 3.2 Message and Certificate Handling
- Messages will be JSON-based, compressed (e.g., using zlib) before Base64 encoding for compactness, ensuring ease of copy-paste in limited-character environments.
- QR code images will serve as an alternative format, generated using libraries such as qrcode, with the payload encoding the same JSON data (including session details, preferences, expiry, and verifiable credentials). Recipients can scan or upload QR codes for processing, with server-side decoding via libraries like pyzbar.
- Certificates will follow the W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) model, including cryptographic proofs, issuance timestamps, and claims for payment details (e.g., amount, parties, partial payments). These will be embedded in messages, QR codes, and responses, allowing external systems to verify and trigger actions like goods release.
- Functional safeguards include:
  - Expiry timestamps to invalidate stale requests.
  - Unique message IDs and database tracking to prevent duplicate processing.
  - Support for partial payments via a dedicated field in requests and certificates.
  - Fallback mechanisms for custom payment methods when preferences cannot be met.
  - User validation through decoding to JSON and validity confirmation in /decodeMessage.

##### 3.3 Deployment and Technology Stack
- **Environments**: Linux laptop for development; Linux cloud (e.g., via Docker containers) for testing and production.
- **Stack**: Python 3.x with FastAPI for the API layer; SQLite for lightweight session storage; libraries such as pydantic for validation, cryptography for signatures, zlib for compression, qrcode for QR generation, and pyzbar with Pillow for QR decoding. Containerization with Docker ensures consistency across environments.

##### 3.4 Use Cases
The backend supports practical applications, including:
- Personal remittances: Users exchange messages or QR code images via messaging apps for secure confirmations in low-connectivity settings.
- Freelance payments: Freelancers specify preferences and receive verifiable certificates for service delivery.
- Merchant transactions: Businesses generate requests with preferences, using certificates to automate order fulfillment.
- Decentralized finance: Off-chain confirmations with proofs for on-chain events, including partial settlements.

#### 4. Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1: Core Development (2-4 weeks)**: Implement API endpoints, message encoding/decoding with compression, basic session management in SQLite, and new /decodeMessage endpoint for user validation.
- **Phase 2: Enhancements (2-3 weeks)**: Integrate verifiable credentials, payee preferences (structured hybrid model), expiry/duplicate checks, partial payment support, status querying, and QR code generation/processing.
- **Phase 3: Testing and Deployment (1-2 weeks)**: Unit testing with pytest; simulate workflows, including QR scanning; deploy via Docker on cloud instances.
- **Resources Required**: Developer time; access to Linux environments; no additional hardware beyond standard setups.

#### 5. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Message or QR length/size issues in certain platforms. **Mitigation**: Compression, QR optimization, and testing across sample messengers.
- **Risk**: User errors in copy-paste or scanning. **Mitigation**: Clear API responses with validation prompts and fallback options.
- **Risk**: Database scalability for high sessions. **Mitigation**: Start with SQLite; migrate to PostgreSQL if needed in production.
- **Risk**: Complexity in user validation. **Mitigation**: Limit to basic decoding in Phase 1; expand in Phase 2.

#### 6. Future Expansions
- Integrate a user interface for message handling.
- Add wallet/coin management and fiat/crypto gateways.
- Develop a direct network interface to bypass external messaging platforms.
- Incorporate a higher-level human language interface (e.g., chatbot) for natural transaction flows.

This updated proposal provides a focused blueprint for a functional, extensible backend, now incorporating user validation in Phase 1. Approval and feedback are requested to proceed with detailed design and prototyping.
